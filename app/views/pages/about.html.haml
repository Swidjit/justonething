%p Swidjit is an Ithaca-based social media platform platform designed to facilitate the local economy and access to local information, news, activities, and people. More specifically, it's for buying, selling, trading, sharing, renting, giving, discussing, and otherwise networking with others around you. As a replacement for Craigslist and a supplement to Facebook, Swidjit hopes to become the de facto tool to connect people, places, things and organizations.

%p Work on Swidjit first began in early 2011. Our demo platform was released in July of 2011 and was used as a placeholder to attract interest as we fully fleshed out the idea for this new technology. The May 1, 2012 release of our new website represents the actual beginning of Swidjit in earnest, and we are very excited to see where it goes!  we will be prototyping the concept in Tompkins County for the next few months, and if it goes well we hope to expand regionally to Binghamton, Syracuse, and Elmira.

%p We are actively looking to collaborate with local businesses, organizations, and individuals who have something to contribute to Swidjitâ€™s growth.  If you would like to work or collaborate with Swidjit, please contact us.
